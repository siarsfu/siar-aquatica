Sleepless Underwater Effects - Version 2.0.0.0

Overview
========

The project is fairly self explanatory but if you have any questions or issues transitioning this effect into your own projects then please contact me as per the details at the bottom of this file.
The core effect is managed in the submerged effect script which is attached to the MainCameras in the demo scenes. 
If you have a look at the MainCameras Submerged Effect GameObject, the underwater settings are controlled from here.

Whats new in 2.0?
=================

1. As per Unity Asset Store Policy, we have removed all of the Unity Standard Effects from Version 2.0 and replaced the effects and controllers with basic alternatives. We strongly recommend you use the free Water surface from the Unity Standard Assets for a more realistic water plane for use with this asset. 
The below Tutorial Video can explain how to wire this effect up to the Unity Standard First Person Controller if you are still interested in using it. It will also help explain how to wire up the water to use the Unity Water if you are interested. 

2. We have added a Third Person Controller Scene to show how the effect will work in the 3rd Person as well as the 1st Person Controller scene. 

3. We have added a Fixed Camera (Aquarium) Scene to demo how it would look in a fixed canmera scene. 

4. We have introduced a new variable called m_IsSwimming as well. This has been frequently requested to allow the player to surface and control the movement in the water with SPACE and C keys as opposed to previously where as soon as the camera went underwater, the player sank slowly.
